# OTP-Extension-2FA 💞



# Info 📌
**Rafas OTP is a fully open-source Chrome Extension that supports QR Code scanning and Auth Key entry.**

**It also allows storing the key in the UI.
However, in this version, clicking to copy the key is not supported — this feature might be added in the next advanced version.**

**You are allowed to modify the source code and publish it on the Chrome Store,
but you are not allowed to publish it on GitHub as-is without crediting the original creator!**

#   The Tutorial 🍭
**1 -
enable Developer Mode <>
in the Extensions settings of your browser to allow adding custom files to the browser.**

**2 - 
extract ```Icons.7z``` (Archive)
and convert it into a regular folder.
Then, gather all the files into one folder and add it to the browser.**
